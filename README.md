This is a project about studying the flux inside a Fermi liquid, which is based on dualization between a spin system and fermion&amp;boson


The function of the files are the following:

parameterize.m
establish the parameterization of the model, like (linear) system size, hopping amplitute, etc.

H_BdG.m
build up the BdG Hamiltonian, which depends on the position of the flux
